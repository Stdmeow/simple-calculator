# Simple Calculator

This project is a simple web-based calculator built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to create a functional calculator with a modern design and implement best practices for web development.


# Task

The main goal of this project is to implement a fully functional calculator as described in the provided task document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpXXeSae-BlcxPKgw3DhxZA92cspVailrPYoaXSYrW8/edit?tab=t.0


## Project Features

* **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports standard operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Modulo Operator (%)**: The percentage button works as a modulo operator (`%`) and computes the remainder of a division.
* **Floating-Point Support**: Correctly handles calculations with decimal numbers.
* **Live Expression Display**: The full expression (e.g., `10 + 20`) is displayed on the screen as you type.
* **Theme Management**: A theme switcher allows the user to switch between a dark and a light color scheme.
* **Clean Code**: The project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** to ensure consistent code style and quality.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a clear folder structure to keep the source code and build files separate.

simple-calculator/
├── src/
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── index.js          # Main JavaScript file with all calculator logic
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css         # All CSS styles for the calculator
│   └── index.html            # The main HTML file and template
├── dist/                     # Folder for the production build
├── .eslintrc.json            # ESLint configuration
├── .prettierrc.json          # Prettier configuration
├── package.json              # Project dependencies and scripts
└── webpack.config.js         # Webpack build configuration


### Folder Descriptions

* **`src/`**: Contains all the source files that a developer would work with, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **`src/js/`**: Holds the main application logic written in JavaScript.
* **`src/css/`**: Contains the stylesheet for the application's design.
* **`dist/`**: This folder is automatically generated by Webpack and contains the optimized, ready-to-deploy files.

## How to Run

To get the project running on your local machine, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    Open your terminal in the root directory of the project and run the following command to install all the required packages listed in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run in development mode**:
    To start a local development server and view the project in your browser, use the following command. This will automatically open the page and reload it whenever you make changes to the code.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Build for production**:
    To create a production-ready version of the project (optimized and minimized), run the build command. The final files will be placed in the `dist` folder.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```


After running `npm run build`, you can open the `index.html` file from the `dist` folder in your browser to see the final, optimized application.
